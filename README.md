# Retro FA Skin
This is a skin for Furaffinity that makes it look closer to 2000's-early 2010's websites like DeviantArt and Nitrome.

The skin requires two components: the **user style**, and the **user script**. Keep reading for installation instructions.

# Installation
1. Install the Stylus extension for user styles
   - You can find this by searching "Stylus extension [your browser]". It is available for Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and probably other browsers
2. Install the Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey extension for user scripts
   - If you are using **Firefox**, you want to get Greasemonkey
   - If you are using a **Chromium based browser** (Chrome, Opera, etc.), you want to get Tampermonkey
3. Install the user style AND user script
   - This can be done easily by simply clicking the following links. Stylus and Tampermonkey will automatically open up the file in an installation window.
   - User Style: https://github.com/deaathtraap/Retro-FA-Skin/raw/main/Retro_FA_Beta.user.css
   - User Script: https://github.com/deaathtraap/Retro-FA-Skin/raw/main/Retro%20FA%20Userscript.user.js

Have fun!
